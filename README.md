# 🚢 SeaRoute-Logistics–Analyzer SQL-Based Global Shipping Logistics Optimizer

**SeaRoute-Logistics–Analyzer** is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to simulate real-world logistics operations using SQL. The project analyzes a realistic shipping dataset of over **10,000 records**, covering **shipment delays, container utilization, port performance, fuel consumption**, and **vessel efficiency**. 

This project is ideal for showcasing advanced SQL skills, domain-specific analysis in logistics and maritime operations, and your ability to work with large-scale, structured data — exactly what logistics firms, SaaS platforms, and consulting companies look for in analysts.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an SQL-driven logistics intelligence solution that helps businesses uncover operational inefficiencies, performance bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities across global shipping routes. The project mimics a real-life shipping company's internal analytics dashboard, using pure SQL to deliver key performance indicators (KPIs) and recommendations.

Whether it’s identifying underutilized containers, calculating on-time delivery rates, or analyzing fuel efficiency of cargo vessels — this project provides end-to-end insight into the inner workings of modern supply chains.
